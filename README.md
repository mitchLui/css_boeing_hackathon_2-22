## 1.3. Our Project

We created a Google-Map like application that allows users to search for a location and then view the weather and traffic information for that location, but specically for methods that promotes sustainable shared mobility and transport e.g. e-scooters.

The data is provided by different 3rd party APIs (credited below), and the navigation algorithm is written from scratch that uses a clustering method (we decided to name it G-Cluster).

3rd Party APIs include:

- Voi
- Tier
- Santander
- Electric Vehicles
- Transport API

## 1.4. Tech Stack

**Application**: Docker Compose

**Frontend**: React + MapBox API

**Backend**: FastAPI

## 1.5. Deployment

### 1.5.1. Requirements

Before reading instructions for development and deployment, a .env file under `server/routers/internal` is required.

A sample .env file can be found in the directory. 

### Development

Install:

- frontend dependencies by running `npm install` in `frontend` directory
- backend dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in `server` directory

### Deployment

Install:

- Docker (and Compose)


### 1.5.2. Creating the compose network

Run this shell script:

```sh
./make_compose.sh
```

This creates a compose network with 2 containers:

- `frontend` with assigned port 8080
- `backend` with assigned port 5001
